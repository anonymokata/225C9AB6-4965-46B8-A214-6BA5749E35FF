Description of the exercise



Strategy used to solve the problem

   1. First look at the input/output requirements:
   operands: lowercase alphabet
   operators: ^/*-+
   parenthesis: only for Infix notation and invalid for RPN notation

   So the first thing that enters my mind is to make sure that the input string makes sense.  Some kind of
   sanity-check function to check if the input string makes sense.  Types of invalid input:

   Inifix type:
   3+3
   A+B
   FOO_*
   +3

   RPN type:
   (A+B)
   *AB

   In line with the above, it also makes sense to check if our opening and closing parenthesis are sane.

   Invalid:
   ((a+b)
   (((a+b)*(c+d))))

   So the first step is going to be input parsing before we get to the fun stuff.

   2.  Once we know we have the right characters and symbols, what about syntax?  
   ++ab doesn't make sense, and neither does (a+bb) or (a+b+)
